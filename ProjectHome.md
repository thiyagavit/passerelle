Passerelle is a component-based solution assembly suite, developed and distributed by iSencia Belgium since 2002.
It comes with an execution engine, actor development API, reusable actor libraries and model design IDE.

It is based on an integration and on extensions of [Ptolemy II](http://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/) (Univ. Berkeley), [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage) / [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) & other OS libraries.

Passerelle is already used for several years in “production-mode” at different sites (e.g. at a leading telecom for its automated diagnostic engine for repair and customer support, based on integration with [JBoss Drools](http://www.jboss.org/drools/); at [Synchrotron Soleil](http://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/) for control and data acquisition for experiments on beamlines, based on integration with the [Tango control system](http://www.tango-controls.org/) ).

Since 2012, Passerelle’s usage in the synchrotron domain has been extended towards an integration in a desktop tool based on eclipse RCP, for visiting scientists, where Passerelle will serve as a data analysis sequencer/workflow.

This feature-rich tool is now available as [DAWN](http://www.dawnsci.org/).

To better support this new distribution model in such a scientific community, we have decided together with the customer consortium involved to go towards a regular open source model.

The main deliverable of this open source project is the actual Passerelle core engine, integrated in a graphical editor and execution environment and delivered as a set of OSGi bundles and eclipse plugins together with a prepackaged eclipse RCP application.

The first official release was tagged as Passerelle v7.0.0.
Many intermediate versions with core improvements have been delivered in the meantime.

Currently, the delivery of v8.8.0 is being finalized.


Since Google changed its policies for the Downloads-page, pre-built binary packages are no longer available there.
