<p>
Simple actor that reads input tokens and and forwards them to the output port
 after a configurable accumulating delay (ms).
 <p>
 This actor picks a received message, then sleeps for the configured time,
 then sends out the received message. And then does it again for the next received message.
 </p>
 <p>
 The net-result is a throttling on a received stream of messages. 
 I.e. when incoming messages arrive with a higher frequency than the configured delay, this actor buffers them
 and sends them out one-by-one with approximately constant time intervals.
 When the incoming message stream is "slower" than the configured delay, i.e. messages arrive with an interval that is
 longer than the configured delay, this actor results in a constant delay for each message.
