/**
 <p>This director implements the discrete-event (DE) model of computation (MoC).
 It should be used as the local director of a CompositeActor that is
 to be executed according to the DE MoC. This director maintains a totally
 ordered set of events and processes these events in the order defined on
 their tags and depths.
 </p><p>
 An event is associated with a tag, which is a tuple of timestamp and
 microstep. A timestamp indicates the model time when this event occurs. It
 is an object of the {@link ptolemy.actor.util.Time} class. A microstep is an
 integer which represents the index of the sequence of execution phases when
 this director processes events with the same timestamp. Two tags are equal
 if they have the same timestamp and microstep. If two events have the same
 tag, they are called simultaneous events.
 </p><p>
 Microsteps can only be increased by calling the fireAt() method. For example,
 when an actor requests to be fired again at the current model time, a
 new event with the same timestamp but a bigger microstep (incremented by 1)
 will be generated.
 </p><p>
 An event is also associated with a depth reflecting its priority, based
 on which a DE director chooses the execution order for simultaneous events.
 A depth is an integer and a larger value of depth indicates a lower priority.
 The depth of an event is determined by topologically sorting all the ports
 of actors according to their data dependencies over which there is no time
 delay.
 </p><p>
 The order of events is defined as follows. An event A is said to be earlier
 than another event B if A's timestamp is smaller than B's; or if A's
 timestamp is the same as B's, and A's microstep is smaller than B's; or if
 A's tag is the same as B's, and A's depth is smaller than B's. By giving
 events this well-defined order, this director can handle simultaneous events
 in a deterministic way.
 </p><p>
 The bottleneck in a typical DE simulator is in the maintenance of the
 global event queue. This director uses the calendar queue as the global
 event queue. This is an efficient algorithm with O(1) time complexity in
 both enqueue and dequeue operations. Sorting in the
 {@link ptolemy.actor.util.CalendarQueue} class is done according to the
 order defined above.
 </p><p>
 The complexity of the calendar algorithm is sensitive to the length of the
 event queue. When the size of the event queue becomes too long or changes
 very often, the simulation performance suffers from the penalties of queuing
 and dequeuing events. A few mechanisms are implemented to reduce such
 penalties by keeping the event queue short. The first mechanism is to only
 store in the event queue <i>pure</i> events and the <i>trigger</i> events
 with the same timestamp and microstep as those of the director. See
 {@link DEEvent} for explanation of these two types of events. What is more,
 no duplicate trigger events are allowed in the event queue. Another mechanism
 is that in a hierarchical model, each level keeps a local event queue.
 A lower level only reports the earliest event to its upper level
 to schedule a future firing. The last mechanism is to maintain a list which
 records all actors that are disabled. Any triggers sent to the actors in
 this list are discarded.
 </p><p>
 In the initialize() method, depths of actors and IO ports are statically
 analyzed and calculated. They are not calculated in the preinitialize()
 method because hierarchical models may change their structures during their
 preinitialize() method. For example, a modal model does not specify its
 initial state (and its refinement) until the end of its preinitialize()
 method. See {@link ptolemy.domains.fsm.kernel.FSMActor}. In order to support
 mutation, this director recalculates the depths at the beginning of its next
 iteration.
 </p><p>
 There are two types of depths: one is associated with IO ports, which
 reflects the order of trigger events; the other one is associated with
 actors, which is for pure events. The relationship between the depths of IO
 ports and actors is that the depth of an actor is the smallest of the depths
 of its IO ports. Pure events can only be produced by calling the fireAt()
 method, and trigger events can only be produced by actors that produce
 outputs. See {@link ptolemy.domains.de.kernel.DEReceiver#put}.
 </p><p>
 Directed loops of IO ports with no delay are not permitted because it is
 impossible to do a topological sort to assign depths. Such a loop can be
 broken by inserting some special actors, such as the <i>TimedDelay</i> actor.
 If zero delay in the loop is truly required, then set the <i>delay</i>
 parameter of those actors to zero. This zero-delay actor plays the same
 role as that of delta delay in VHDL. Note that the detection of directed
 loops are based on port connections rather than data dependencies between
 actors because port connections reflect the data dependencies more
 accurately. The information of port connections are stored in the
 nonpersistent attribute <i>FunctionDependency</i>.
 </p><p>
 An input port in a DE model contains an instance of DEReceiver.
 When a token is put into a DEReceiver, that receiver posts a trigger
 event to the director. This director sorts trigger events in a global event
 queue.
 </p><p>
 An iteration, in the DE domain, is defined as processing all the events
 whose tags are equal to the current tag of the director (also called the
 model tag). At the beginning of the fire() method, this director dequeues
 a subset of the earliest events (the ones with smallest timestamp, microstep,
 and depth) from the global event queue. These events have the same
 destination actor. Then, this director invokes that actor to iterate.
 This actor must consume tokens from its input port(s),
 and usually produces new events on its output port(s). These new events will
 be trigger the receiving actors to fire. It is important that the actor
 actually consumes tokens from its inputs, even if the tokens are solely
 used to trigger reactions. This is how polymorphic actors are used in the
 DE domain. The actor will be fired repeatedly until there are no more tokens
 in its input ports, or the actor returns false in its prefire() method. Then,
 this director keeps dequeuing and processing the earliest events from the
 event queue until no more events have the same tag as the model tag.
 After calling the postfire() method, this director finishes an iteration.
 This director is responsible to advance the model tag to perform another
 iteration.
 </p><p>
 A model starts from the time specified by <i>startTime</i>, which
 has default value 0.0. The stop time of the execution can be set
 using the <i>stopTime</i> parameter. The parameter has a default value
 <i>Infinity</i>, which means the execution runs forever.
 </p><p>
 Execution of a DE model ends when the timestamp of the earliest event
 exceeds the stop time. This stopping condition is checked inside
 the postfire() method of this director. By default, execution also ends
 when the global event queue becomes empty. Sometimes, the desired
 behaviour is for the director to wait on an empty queue until another
 thread makes new events available. For example, a DE actor may produce
 events when a user hits a button on the screen. To prevent ending the
 execution when there are no more events, set the
 <i>stopWhenQueueIsEmpty</i> parameter to <code>false</code>.
 </p><p>
 Parameters <i>isCQAdaptive</i>, <i>minBinCount</i>, and
 <i>binCountFactor</i>, are used to configure the calendar queue.
 Changes to these parameters are ignored when the model is running.
 </p><p>
 If the parameter <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
 then the director will not process events until the real time elapsed
 since the model started matches the timestamp of the event.
 This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time. However,
 of course, this does not ensure that the director keeps up with real time.
 </p><p>
 This director tolerates changes to the model during execution.
 The change should be queued with a component in the hierarchy using
 requestChange().  While invoking those changes, the method
 invalidateSchedule() is expected to be called, notifying the director
 that the topology it used to calculate the priorities of the actors
 is no longer valid.  This will result in the priorities (depths of actors)
 being recalculated the next time prefire() is invoked.</p>
