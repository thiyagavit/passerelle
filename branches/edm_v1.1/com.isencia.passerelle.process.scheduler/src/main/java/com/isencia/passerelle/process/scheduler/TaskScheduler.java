/**
 * <p>
 * Contract for a service that provides a scheduling mechanism
 * for handling tasks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All tasks should be delivered to the scheduler via the accept(...) method.
 * <br>
 * The component that is responsible for the actual handling of the tasks is
 * identified by the handler that is also passed as argument.
 * <br>
 * When the given task has been selected for treatment, the matching handler
 * will be notified with the entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This contract is in a similar problem domain as a <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code>.
 * We've taken e.g. the shutdown()-related stuff from there.
 * We should investigate if a <code>TaskScheduler</code> can not be considered as an
 * extension/specialization of an <code>ExecutorService</code>...
 * </p>
